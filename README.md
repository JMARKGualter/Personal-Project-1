# Personal-Projects

Good day!
This is one of my personal projects, which I also submitted as my final project for the Data Structures and Algorithms course. The project focuses on assisting data analysts with visualizing data, cleaning and sorting raw data from CSV files, and identifying relationships between data columns. It also includes various helpful functions relevant to data analysis.

How to use it:

-Download the entire project file.
-Run Login.py.
-Create an account or click the "Login as Guest" button.
-Agree to the terms and conditions.
-Enjoy the GUI I created!
